# *The-Producer-and-Consumer-Problem*
Submitted by: **Osaze Imohe**

## Overview

The Producer and Consumer problem is an illustration of one of the many uses of multithreading in Java. 

## The Code
This repository consists od three files. The producer, The Consumer and the Queue. The Producer produces an integer and add it to a buffer. The file Queue.java
is a circular Queue that acts as a buffer. As the producer adds integers to the buffer the consume simultaneously consumes those integers. The program returns 
the number of integers the producer produced, the number of integers the consumer consumed, and the number of integers currently in the buffer at the time of
both threads stopping
